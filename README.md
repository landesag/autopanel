GitCMS
======

GitCMS is an extensible CMS, using Git as the backend. Designed for static site
edition, but can be used anywhere.

How it works
------------

To access your projects, you login with a login provider. The client uses your
credentials to read and update your projects on your behalf, but they don't
ever leave your computer.
Didn't find your favourite provider?
It's easy to add new ones with our plugin system.

Each project has a schema with a description of every entity type, including
their fields and labels, and where to store the data.
Field types are plugins too, so you can create your own, but we included the
usual ones you expect on any CMS, like WYSIWYG or date.

Usage
-----

To try Gitcms, we provide a demo project. Just clone
[gitcms-app](https://github.com/mancontr/gitcms-app) and use `yarn` and
`yarn start`. You can use NPM insead, too.
Either way, the project will start on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Developing
----------

To try your changes in Gitcms, clone this repo and use `yarn link`, then link it
in the demo project with `yarn link gitcms`. We also provide a "watch mode" to
rebuild the bundle on change, which you can start with `yarn watch`.

Work in progress
----------------

We're in the middle of a migration to React alpha features: hooks and suspense.

On src/gitcms we have a context provider, which allows setting the current
project, entity type, and id, and passes the aggregated info down, exposing
an API which uses them to call the provider/storage and perform all actions.
These actions throw promises while loading info, just as with `react-cache`.
The user token and info is saved on the localStorage, and loaded on mount.

Known bugs: We don't invalidate caches yet, so entities/lists/...
can't get updated.
